# Summary

This experiment demonstrates how to build a price elasticity model with combos and external factors.

Why is this project important? 

> “ **Price elasticity is the foundation of price optimization. This experiment uses the transaction data of Always Sunscreen product to show how to get price elasticity when users need to deal with combos and add external information including weather and holiday into the pricing model.**  ”

Remember you need two line breaks in your code to actually have a line break in the page and having spaces in the begining of the line will change the layout (depending on the number of spaces).

There are other useful markdown features like tables, emojis, [html entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references) and... old school HTML:

And if you wish to include formulae in your wiki article then you can embed LaTex like this:

```math
{\displaystyle \mu (\{x\in X\,:\,\,|f(x)|\geq t\})\leq {1 \over t^{p}}\int _{|f|\geq t}|f|^{p}\,d\mu .}
```

When $`a \ne 0`$, there are two solutions to $`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`$
